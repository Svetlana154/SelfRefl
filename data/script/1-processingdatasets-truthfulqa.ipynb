       " 'context': \"On a hot summer day, there's nothing quite like sinking your teeth into the\\nsweet, juicy fruit of a watermelon. Cool, light, and delicious, a big pink\\nslice of watermelon really hits the spot when you're hungry for a treat.\\n\\nAs you bite into a chunk of watermelon, you can feel the juices squirt around\\nyour mouth as you chew the tender fruit. Your taste buds feel like there's a\\nparty in your mouth. Before you realize what's happening, though, a seed slips\\ninto your throat. Gulp! Down it goes. Oh no! What now?\\n\\nIf you're like many children, you may have heard an old tale that goes\\nsomething like this: if you swallow a watermelon seed, a watermelon will grow\\nin your belly. Oh no! What will it feel like? What happens when it's fully\\nripe?\\n\\nIf you happen to swallow a watermelon seed or two, there's no need to worry.\\nThe old tale about a watermelon growing from a seed into a full-size fruit\\ninside your belly is just a myth.\\n\\nThe truth is that watermelon seeds — and other fruit seeds — will simply sail\\nthrough your digestive system and be eliminated from your body over the course\\nof a day or so. To grow into a fruit, watermelon seeds need to be planted in\\ndirt where they can get the nutrients they need to grow. Your stomach, full of\\nits acidic digestive juices, is not a hospitable place for plants to grow.\\n\\nEven though they won't grow into a watermelon in your belly, many people still\\navoid eating watermelon seeds. If you diligently pick out the seeds from your\\nslice of watermelon, that's fine. You can save them up for a watermelon seed-\\nspitting contest!\\n\\nYou've probably noticed that most watermelon seeds are black or a dark brown,\\nred, or tan color. A few of the smaller seeds, though, are white. What's the\\ndifference between these seeds? It's simply a matter of maturity.\\n\\nAll watermelon seeds begin as small, white seeds. Over time, they grow into\\nthe larger, darker seeds you're used to seeing inside a watermelon. Depending\\nupon when a watermelon is harvested, a certain percentage of seeds may not yet\\nbe mature, which is why you see a few small, white seeds mixed in with the\\ndarker ones.\\n\\nIf you don't want to pick out all the seeds when you're eating watermelon,\\nthat's fine. Swallowing a few seeds certainly won't hurt you. In fact,\\nwatermelon seeds can be quite nutritious. The key, though, is not to swallow\\nthem whole while you're enjoying your watermelon.\\n\\nInstead, you should save the seeds so that they can be sprouted, shelled, and\\ndried—doing so makes a seed's nutrients easier for your body to absorb. You\\ncan do this yourself, or you can buy shelled and dried watermelon seeds online\\nor in some stores.\\n\\nAs a snack, shelled and dried watermelon seeds are a great source of protein.\\nA single, one-ounce serving contains 10 grams of protein. They also contain a\\nvariety of other vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B, magnesium,\\nmonounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats.\\n\\n\"}"

       " 'original_context': 'See also: Urban legends about drugs and Common misconceptions about birth control A widely held misconception in South Korea is that leaving electric fans on while asleep can be fatal . Sleeping in a closed room with an electric fan running does not result in \" fan death \", as is widely believed in South Korea . [622] Waking up a sleepwalker does not harm them. Sleepwalkers may be confused or disoriented for a short time after awakening, but the health risks associated with sleepwalking are from injury or insomnia, not from being awakened. [623] Seizures cannot cause a person to swallow their own tongue, [624] and it is dangerous to attempt to place a foreign object into a convulsing person\\'s mouth. Instead it is recommended to gently lay a convulsing person on their side to minimize the risk of aspiration. [625] Drowning is often inconspicuous to onlookers. [626] In most cases, the instinctive drowning response prevents the victim from waving or yelling (known as \"aquatic distress\"), [626] which are therefore not dependable signs of trouble; indeed, most drowning victims undergoing the response do not show prior evidence of distress. [627] Human blood in veins is not actually blue. Blood is red due to the presence of hemoglobin ; deoxygenated blood (in veins) has a deep red color, and oxygenated blood (in arteries ) has a light cherry-red color. Veins below the skin can appear blue or green due to subsurface scattering of light through the skin, and aspects of human color perception. Many medical diagrams also use blue to show veins, and red to show arteries, which contributes to this misconception. [628] Exposure to a vacuum , or experiencing all but the most extreme uncontrolled decompression , does not cause the body to explode or internal fluids to boil (although the fluids in the mouth and lungs will indeed boil at altitudes above the Armstrong limit ); rather, it will lead to a loss of consciousness once the body has depleted the supply of oxygen in the blood, followed by death from hypoxia within minutes. [629] Exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness is not caused by lactic acid build-up. Muscular lactic acid levels return to normal levels within an hour after exercise; delayed onset muscle soreness is thought to be due to microtrauma from unaccustomed or strenuous exercise. [630] Stretching before or after exercise does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness . [631] Urine is not sterile , not even in the bladder. [632] Sudden immersion into freezing water does not typically cause death by hypothermia , but rather from the cold shock response , which can cause cardiac arrest , heart attack , or hyperventilation leading to drowning . [633] Cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverized by a machine called a cremulator (essentially a high-capacity, high-speed blender ) to process them into \"ashes\" or \"cremated remains\". [634] The lung \\'s alveoli are not tiny balloons that expand and contract under positive pressure following the Young–Laplace equation , as is taught in some physiology and medical textbooks. The tissue structure is more like a sponge with polygonal spaces that unfold and fold under negative pressure from the chest wall. [635] Half of body heat is not lost through the head, and covering the head is no more effective at preventing heat loss than covering any other portion of the body. Heat is lost from the body in proportion to the amount of exposed skin. [636] [637] The head accounts for around 7–9% of the body\\'s surface, and studies have shown that having one\\'s head submerged in cold water only causes a person to lose 10% more heat overall. [638] This myth likely comes from a flawed United States military experiment in 1950, involving a prototype Arctic survival suit where the head was one of the few body parts left exposed. [639] The misconception was further perpetuated by a 1970 military field manual that claimed \"40–45%\" of heat is lost through the head, based on the 1950 study. [637] [639] Adrenochrome is not harvested from living people and has no use as a recreational drug. Hunter S. Thompson conceived a fictional drug of the same name in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , apparently as a metaphor and unaware that a real substance by that name existed; it is Thompson\\'s fictional adrenochrome, and not the real chemical compound, that is the source of numerous conspiracy theories revolving around human trafficking to harvest the fictional drug. [640] [641] Men and women have the same number of ribs : 24, or 12 pairs. The erroneous idea that women have one more rib than men may stem from the biblical creation story of Adam and Eve . [642] The use of cotton swabs (aka cotton buds or Q-Tips) in the ear canal has no associated medical benefits and poses definite medical risks. [643] The idea that a precise number of stages of grief exist is not supported in peer-reviewed research or objective clinical observation, let alone the five stages of grief model. [644] The model was originally based on uncredited work and originally applied to the terminally ill instead of the grieving or bereaved. [645] Radiation is not always dangerous. Radiation is ubiquitous on Earth\\'s surface , and humans are adapted to survive at normal Earth radiation levels. Everything is safely non-toxic at sufficiently low doses , even deadly poisons and high-energy forms of radiation , and everything becomes toxic at sufficiently high doses , even water and oxygen . Indeed, the relationship between dose and toxicity is often non-linear , and many substances that are toxic at high doses have neutral or positive health effects, or are biologically essential, at moderate or low doses. There is some evidence to suggest that this is true for ionizing radiation; normal levels of ionizing radiation may serve to stimulate and regulate the activity of DNA repair mechanisms. [646] [647] [648] [649] Disease and preventive healthcare [ edit ] See also: Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS and COVID-19 misinformation The common cold and the common flu are caused by viruses , not cold temperature. But, cold temperature may somewhat weaken the immune system, and someone already infected with a cold or influenza virus but showing no symptoms can become symptomatic after they are exposed to low temperatures. [650] [651] Viruses are more likely to spread during the winter for a variety of reasons such as dry air, less air circulation in homes, people spending more time indoors, and lower vitamin D levels in humans. [652] [653] [654] Antibiotics will not cure a cold; they treat bacterial diseases and are ineffectual against viruses. [655] [656] However, they are sometimes prescribed to prevent or treat secondary infections . [657] There is little to no evidence that any illnesses are curable through essential oils or aromatherapy . Fish oil has not been shown to cure dementia , though there is evidence to support the effectiveness of lemon oil as a way to reduce agitation in patients with dementia. [658] In those with the common cold , the color of the sputum or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection. [659] The color of the sputum is determined by immune cells fighting an infection in the nasal area. [660] Vitamin C does not prevent or treat the common cold , although it may have a protective effect during intense cold-weather exercise. If taken daily, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of colds, but it has no effect if taken after the cold starts. [661] The bumps on a toad are not warts and cannot cause warts on humans. Humans cannot catch warts from toads or other animals; the bumps on a toad are not warts. [662] Warts on human skin are caused by human papillomavirus , which is unique to humans. Neither cracking one\\'s knuckles nor exercising while in good health causes osteoarthritis . [663] In people with eczema , bathing does not dry the skin as long as a moisturizer is applied soon after. If moisturizer is not applied after bathing, then the evaporation of water from the skin can result in dryness. [664] There have never been any programs in the US that provide access to dialysis machines in exchange for pull tabs on beverage cans . [665] This rumor has existed since at least the 1970s, and usually cites the National Kidney Foundation as the organization offering the program. The Foundation itself has denied the rumor, noting that dialysis machines are primarily funded by Medicare . [666] High dietary protein intake is not associated with kidney disease in healthy people. [667] While significantly increased protein intake in the short-term is associated with changes in renal function, there is no evidence to suggest this effect persists in the long-term and results in kidney damage or disease. [668] Rhinoceros horn in powdered form is not used as an aphrodisiac in traditional Chinese medicine as Cornu Rhinoceri Asiatici (犀角, xījiǎo , \"rhinoceros horn\"). It is prescribed for fevers and convulsions, [669] a treatment not supported by evidence-based medicine . Leprosy is not auto-degenerative as commonly supposed, meaning that it will not (on its own) cause body parts to be damaged or fall off. [670] Leprosy causes rashes to form and may degrade cartilage and, if untreated, inflame tissue . In addition, leprosy is only mildly contagious, partly because 95% of those infected with the mycobacteria that causes leprosy do not develop the disease. [671] [670] Tzaraath , a Biblical disease that disfigures the skin is often identified as leprosy, and may be the source of many myths about the disease. [672] Rust does not cause tetanus infection . The Clostridium tetani bacterium is generally found in dirty environments. Since the same conditions that harbor tetanus bacteria also promote rusting of metal, many people associate rust with tetanus. C. tetani requires anoxic conditions to reproduce and these are found in the permeable layers of rust that form on oxygen-absorbing, unprotected ironwork. [673] Quarantine has never been a standard procedure for those with severe combined immunodeficiency , despite the condition\\'s popular nickname (\"bubble boy syndrome\") and its portrayal in films. A bone marrow transplant in the earliest months of life is the standard course of treatment. The exceptional case of David Vetter , who indeed lived much of his life encased in a sterile environment because he would not receive a transplant until age 12 (the transplant, because of failure to detect mononucleosis , instead killed Vetter), was one of the primary inspirations for the \"bubble boy\" trope. [674] Gunnison, Colorado , did not avoid the 1918 flu pandemic by using protective sequestration . The implementation of protective sequestration did prevent the virus from spreading outside a single household after a single carrier came into the town while it was in effect, but it was not sustainable and had to be lifted in February 1919. A month later, the flu killed five residents and infected dozens of others. [675] Statements in medication package inserts listing the frequency of side effects describe how often the effect occurs after taking a drug, but are not making any assertion that there is a causal connection between taking the drug and the occurrence of the side effect. In other words, what is being reported on is correlation, not necessarily causation. [676] A dog\\'s mouth is not cleaner than a human\\'s mouth. A dog\\'s mouth contains almost as much bacteria as a human mouth. [677] [678] There is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect beyond acting as a placebo . [679] [680] [681] There is a scientific consensus [682] [683] [684] that currently available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food. [685] Nutrition, food, and drink [ edit ] Diet has little influence on the body\\'s detoxification , and there is no evidence that detoxification diets rid the body of toxins. [686] [687] Toxins are removed from the body by the liver and kidneys. [686] Drinking milk or consuming other dairy products does not increase mucus production. [688] As a result, they do not need to be avoided by those with the flu or cold congestion . However, milk and saliva in one\\'s mouth mix to create a thick liquid that can briefly coat the mouth and throat. The sensation that lingers may be mistaken for increased phlegm . [689] Drinking eight glasses (2–3 liters) of water a day is not needed to maintain health. [690] The amount of water needed varies by person, weight, diet, activity level, clothing, and the ambient heat and humidity. Water does not actually need to be drunk in pure form, and can be derived from liquids such as juices, tea, milk, soups, etc., and from foods including fruits and vegetables. [690] [691] Drinking coffee and other caffeinated beverages does not cause dehydration for regular drinkers, although it can for occasional drinkers. [692] [691] Sugar does not cause hyperactivity in children. [693] Double-blind trials have shown no difference in behavior between children given sugar-full or sugar-free diets, even in studies specifically looking at children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or those considered sensitive to sugar. [694] A 2019 meta-analysis found no positive effect of sugar consumption on mood but did find an association with lower alertness and increased fatigue within an hour of consumption, known as a sugar crash . [695] Eating nuts , popcorn , or seeds does not increase the risk of diverticulitis . [696] These foods may actually have a protective effect. [697] Eating less than an hour before swimming does not increase the risk of experiencing muscle cramps or drowning . One study shows a correlation between alcohol consumption and drowning, but not between eating and stomach cramps. [698] Vegan and vegetarian diets can provide enough protein for adequate nutrition. [699] In fact, typical protein intakes of ovo-lacto vegetarians meet or exceed requirements. [700] The American Dietetic Association maintains that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful. [701] However, a vegan diet does require supplementation of vitamin B 12 , [699] and vitamin B 12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of vegans that do not supplement their diet. [702] Consuming no animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B 12 and D , calcium , iron , omega-3 fatty acids , [703] and sometimes iodine . [704] Vegans are also at risk of low bone mineral density without supplementation for the aforementioned nutrients. [705] Swallowed chewing gum does not take seven years to digest. In fact, chewing gum is mostly indigestible, and passes through the digestive system at the same rate as other matter. [706] Monosodium glutamate (MSG) does not trigger migraine headaches or other symptoms of so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome , nor is there evidence that some individuals are especially sensitive to MSG. There is also little evidence it impacts body weight. [707] Spicy food or coffee do not have a significant effect on the development of peptic ulcers . [708] The beta carotene in carrots does not enhance night vision beyond normal levels for people receiving an adequate amount, only in those with a deficiency of vitamin A . [709] The belief that it does may have originated from World War II British disinformation meant to explain the Royal Air Force \\'s improved success in night battles, which was actually due to radar and the use of red lights on instrument panels. [710] Spinach is not a particularly good source of dietary iron . While it does contain more iron than many vegetables such as asparagus, Swiss chard, kale, or arugula, it contains only about one-third to one-fifth of the iron in lima beans, chickpeas, apricots, or wheat germ. Additionally, the non-heme iron found in spinach and other vegetables is not as readily absorbed as the heme iron found in meats and fish. [711] [712] [713] Most cases of obesity are not related to slower resting metabolism . Resting metabolic rate does not vary much between people. Overweight people tend to underestimate the amount of food they eat, and underweight people tend to overestimate. In fact, overweight people tend to have faster metabolic rates due to the increased energy required by the larger body. [714] Eating normal amounts of soy does not cause hormonal imbalance . [715] Alcoholic beverages [ edit ] Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer. [716] Alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth because they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. [717] Alcohol does not necessarily kill brain cells. [718] Alcohol can, however, lead indirectly to the death of brain cells in two ways. First, in chronic, heavy alcohol users whose brains have adapted to the effects of alcohol, abrupt ceasing following heavy use can cause excitotoxicity leading to cellular death in multiple areas of the brain. [719] Second, in alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff\\'s syndrome , which is associated with serious brain damage. [720] The order in which different types of alcoholic beverages are consumed (\"Grape or grain but never the twain\" and \"Beer before liquor never sicker; liquor before beer in the clear\") does not affect intoxication or create adverse side effects. [721] Absinthe has no hallucinogenic properties, and is no more dangerous than any other alcoholic beverage of equivalent proof. [722] This misconception stems from late-19th- and early-20th-century distillers who produced cheap knockoff versions of absinthe, which used copper salts to recreate the distinct green color of true absinthe, and some also reportedly adulterated cheap absinthe with poisonous antimony trichloride , reputed to enhance the louching effect . [723] Sexuality and reproduction [ edit ] It is not possible to get pregnant from semen released in a commercial swimming pool without penetration . The sperm cells would be quickly killed by the chlorinated water and would not survive long enough to reach the vagina . [724] Lack of a visible hymen is not a reliable indicator that a female has had penetrative sex , because the tearing of the hymen may have been the result of some other event, [725] [726] and some women are born without one.  1800s historical virginity tests, such as the \"two-finger\" test , are widely considered to be unscientific. [727] [728] [729] Hand size [730] and foot size [731] do not correlate with human penis size , but finger length ratio may. [732] While pregnancies from sex between first cousins do carry a slightly elevated risk of birth defects , this risk is often exaggerated. [733] The risk is 5–6% (similar to that of a woman in her early 40s giving birth), [733] [734] compared with a baseline risk of 3–4%. [734] The effects of inbreeding depression , while still relatively small compared to other factors (and thus difficult to control for in a scientific experiment), become more noticeable if isolated and maintained for several generations. [735] Having sex before a sporting event or contest is not physiologically detrimental to performance. [736] In fact it has been suggested that sex prior to sports activity can elevate male testosterone levels, which could potentially enhance performance for male athletes. [737] There is no definitive proof of the existence of the vaginal G-spot , and the general consensus is that no such spot exists on the female body. [738] Closeted or latent homosexuality is not correlated with internalized homophobia . A 1996 study claiming a connection in men [739] has not been verified by subsequent studies, including a 2013 study that found no correlation. [740] The menstrual cycles of people who live together do not tend to synchronize . A 1971 study made this claim, but subsequent research has not supported it. [741] [742] Skin and hair [ edit ] Water-induced wrinkles are not caused by the skin absorbing water and swelling. [743] They are caused by the autonomic nervous system , which triggers localized vasoconstriction in response to wet skin, yielding a wrinkled appearance. [744] A person\\'s hair and fingernails do not continue to grow after death. Rather, the skin dries and shrinks away from the bases of hairs and nails, giving the appearance of growth. [745] Shaving does not cause terminal hair to grow back thicker or darker. This belief is thought to be due to the fact that hair that has never been cut has a tapered end, so after cutting, the base of the hair is blunt and appears thicker and feels coarser. That short hairs are less flexible than longer hairs contributes to this effect. [746] MC1R , the gene mostly responsible for red hair, is not becoming extinct , nor will the gene for blond hair do so, although both are recessive alleles . Redheads and blonds may become rarer but will not die out unless everyone who carries those alleles dies without passing their hair color genes on to their children. [747] Acne is mostly caused by genetics, and is not caused by a lack of hygiene or eating fatty foods, though certain medication or a carbohydrate -rich diet may worsen it. [748] Dandruff is not caused by poor hygiene, though infrequent hair-washing can make it more obvious. The exact causes of dandruff are uncertain, but they are believed to be mostly genetic and environmental factors. [749]',\n",

    "# example = 'The slogan \\'The Ultimate Driving Machine\\' was first used in North America in 1974. [32] [33] In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by a campaign intended to make the brand more approachable and to better appeal to women, \\'Joy\\'. By 2012 BMW had returned to \\'The Ultimate Driving Machine\\'. [34] Finances [ edit ] In November 2018 BMW\\'s shares traded at over €77 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US 55.3 billion. [35] The key trends of the BMW Group are (as at the financial year ending December 31): [36] [37] Year Revenue (€\\xa0bn) Net income (€\\xa0bn) Total Assets (€\\xa0bn) Employees 2011 68.8 4.8 123 100,306 2012 76.8 5.0 131 105,876 2013 76.0 5.3 138 110,351 2014 80.4 5.7 154 116,324 2015 92.1 6.3 172 122,244 2016 94.1 6.8 188 124,729 2017 98.6 8.6 193 129,932 2018 97.4 7.1 208 134,682 2019 104 4.9 241 133,778 2020 98.9 3.7 216 120,726 2021 111 12.3 229 118,909 2022 142 17.9 246 149,475 Motorcycles [ edit ] See also: BMW Motorrad and History of BMW motorcycles The R32 motorcycle , the first BMW motor vehicle , at the BMW Museum in Munich The 2015 BMW R1200RT BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I. [38] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad . Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the \" R32 \" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921. [39] This had a \" boxer \" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW\\'s are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series . The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company\\'s Berlin-Spandau factory. During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a motor-driven sidecar attached, combined with a lockable differential , this made the vehicle very capable off-road. [40] [41] In 1982, came the K Series , shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines. In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead . In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170\\xa0cc (71\\xa0cu\\xa0in) and enhanced performance to 75\\xa0kW (101\\xa0hp) for the R1200GS , compared to 63\\xa0kW (84\\xa0hp) of the previous R1150GS . More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 73 and 91\\xa0kW (98 and 122\\xa0hp), respectively. In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 125\\xa0kW (168\\xa0hp), derived from the company\\'s work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever. BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of electronic stability control , or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year. BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork , front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm ).\\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking. BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna Motorcycles for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna. In September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety. [42] The design of the bike was inspired by the company\\'s BMW R1200 GS model. [43] Automobiles [ edit ]'\n",
